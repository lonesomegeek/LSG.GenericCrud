# Feature: Entity history tracking @ Historical CRUD
I've been in many scenario when I was asked to track the evolution of an entity through time in an application. This feature simplifies the acquisition of:
- the when? When did the action occured
- the what? What has changed, What action as been executed 
- *the who*? Who did the manipulation on the entity

**Note:** The *who?* is not supported natively by HistoricalCrudController\<T> but is covered by DataFiller\<T> covered in *documentation is coming soon*.

The history tracking feature enables automatic history tracking with few modifications to existing controllers CrudController\<T>.

## What is happening behind the scenes
Before getting into further details, I think this is important for you to understand what is happening behind the scenes.

First of all, when you will define a controller inheriting from HistoricalCrudController\<T>, it will absolutely need a compatible data access layer (DAL) that supports historical transactions. If you do not specifies a compatible *history-ready* DAL to your HistoricalCrudController\<T>, your entity modifications will be saved, but not the history trackng.

Also, the historical events are saved aside of the entities. That means that all historical events of all kind on all entities will be stored in the same table.

Actions that are tracked by HistoricalCrudControllee\<T>:
- Create: First event tracked obviously when the entity is created
- Update: All update events that may occur after the creation
- Delete: This event can only occur once (or never) and it marks the deletion event of the entity

You should know that the entity transaction and history transaction occurs at the same time (same database transaction). If one of the two fails, no database action will occur. Sweet eh (logical I say =P)!?

## How to make it "Historical"
To enable the *Historical* feature, you have few steps to do to make the thing work:
- Change your controller definition to inherit from HistoricalCrudController\<T>
- Change your controller constructor to be injected an *Historical-ready* repository (data access layer @ dal)
- Adapt your database context to support *HistoricalEvents* dataset

### Controller adaptation
Here is a configuration with CrudController\<T> controller:

```csharp
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class AccountsController : CrudController<Account>
{
    public AccountsController(Crud<Account> dal) : base(dal) { }
}
```

Here is a configuration with HistoricalCrudController\<T> controller:
```csharp
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class AccountsController : HistoricalCrudController<Account>
{
    public AccountsController(HistoricalCrud<Account> dal) : base(dal) { }
}
```

### Context adaptation
Adjust your existing context class to include this property:
```csharp
public DbSet<HistoricalEvent> HistoricalEvents { get; set; }
```
This inclusion will enables the HistoricalCrud\<T> DAL to do the tracking of all the events. In future release, I may put settings to let you choose where to drop the entity events (up to you).

## It is a CrudController\<T> plus...
This is programatically-talking a CrudController\<T> with history tracking but with more routes. As a reminder, here is the default routes provided with a CrudController\<T>:

| VERB   | URL               | Description           |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| GET    | /api/accounts     | Retreive all accounts |
| GET    | /api/accounts/:id | Retreive one account  |
| POST   | /api/accounts     | Create one account    |
| PUT    | /api/accounts/:id | Update one account    |
| DELETE | /api/accounts/:id | Delete one account    |

You will get two more routes with an HistoricalCrudController\<T>:

| VERB   | URL                       | Description                                 |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| GET    | /api/accounts/:id/history | Retreive the complete history of an account |
| POST   | /api/accounts/:id/restore | Restore a deleted account (with new id)     |

The first route (/history), will give you the complete history of an entity (from the creation to now), in JSON. You can use this JSON to display a timeline of your entity for exemple.

The second route, will restore a previously deleted entity with a new Id. When you call the DELETE route of an entity, the HistoricalCrud\<T> DAL will keep a copy as the changeset to remember in which state was the entity prior deletion. This will enables the restore route to recreate a new entity with all its original data. Nice eh!?
