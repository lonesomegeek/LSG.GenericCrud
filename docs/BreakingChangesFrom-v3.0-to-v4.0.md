# Reflexion around v3.* version
## TL;DR; Version
When designing v3.*, I was already doing prototypes of new features that are included in v4.0. When trying to implement the new features into v3.*, it was hard to do without doing breaking changes to the design of the historical events. This is way the events changed a bit and why we have a v4.0 instead of v3.1.
